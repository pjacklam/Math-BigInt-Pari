This is Math::BigInt::Pari, a plugin module for Math::BigInt that
replaces Math::BigInt's core math routines with Math::Pari routines.

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm. It needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and
Math::BigFloat as they are from Perl 5.7.x onwards.

How to install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To use it, install Math::Pari and then replace:

    use Math::BigInt;

with this:

    use Math::BigInt lib => 'Pari';

If Math::Pari is not installed, this will safely fall back to Calc, the
default library of Math::BigInt.

Please read the documentation under PERFORMANCE in Math::BigInt on when to
use this module and when not.
