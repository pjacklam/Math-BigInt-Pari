Revision history for Math::BigInt::Pari

1.03  2001.09.02
    - Incorporated Tels's changes: no longer need to EXPORT_OK functions;
      added empty import method.
    - Added _as_hex and _as_bin implementations for Math::Pari integers,
      to support as_hex and as_bin Math::BigInt methods.

1.02  2001.08.05
    - Added _gcd method; uses PARI library function to return gcd.
    - Incorporated Tels's changes: _copy() is now linear; _is_zero,
      _is_one, is_even, and is_odd now use PARI library functions
      rather than overloaded ops and should thus be faster. Also
      added new tests from Math::BigInt 1.40.

1.01  2001.07.14
    - Incorporated Tels's changes per calling args to plugin methods
      (now class is *always* the first arg, so no more checking).
      Fixed some tests per Math::BigInt changes.

1.00  2001.07.11
    - Initial release.
